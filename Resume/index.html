       <strong>Journalism college student</strong>  
       <p>
            I am a sophomore journalism student at the Philip Merrill College of Journalism at the University of Maryland. I am interested in data and investigative journalism, and am working on campus publications to further my journalistic interests. I am also part of the Honors Global Communities living learning program that has given me intermediate R coding skills as well as leadership opportunities.

            <h2>Experience:</h2>
            <h3>Peer Mentor</h3>
            <h4>Philip Merrill College of Journalism</h4>
            <h5>Aug 2023- Dec 2023</h5>
       <p>
        As a peer mentor for the journalism school I guide a group of seven journalism students through their first semester of college. I am responsible for supporting them if they need any help, attending and hosting events for my peers and meeting and evaluating my peers in reports for Merrill college.

            <h3>Digital Marketing Intern</h3>
            <h4>Headfirst Summer Camps</h4>
            <h5>June 2023- Aug 2023</h5>
       <p>
       As the digital marketing intern I created and posted daily content onto Headfirst social media platforms, as well as their blog. My role served as the way parents were able to see what their campers were doing all day, so I posted ten times a day on the blog. In a 220+ person camp I was able to capture at least two photos of each camper during a week, with one individual photo. I aided with the creation and continuation of the company brand.

            <h4>University of Maryland Undergraduate Admissions</h4>
            <h5>Dec 2022- Present</h5>
      <p>
       I lead groups of 10-20 prospective students and parents around campus while addressing questions and concerns in a friendly manner. I also helped interview and train tour guides in training.

            <h4>Stories Beneath the Shell</h4> 
            <h5>Aug 2022- Present</h5>
       <p>
       I started off as a social media creator and staff writer, where I would post weekly on Reddit about new articles and create posts for Instagram. I would also write weekly articles on a variety of topics. Now as Co-General Assignment Editor I am responsible for holding weekly GA meetings and creating pitches.
